Algorithm for 3x3 matrix


3x3 Matrix Algorithm:

Initialize a 3x3 matrix with any values.
Create a for loop that iterates through each row of the matrix.
Within the for loop, create a nested for loop that iterates through each column of the matrix.
Within the nested for loop, access the current element by its row and column indices and perform any desired operation on it.
Continue iterating through the matrix until all elements have been processed.
